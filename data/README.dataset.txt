# Overview

We have captured and annotated photos of six-sided dice. There are 359 total images from a few sets:

- 154 single dice of various styles on a white table
- 388 [Catan](https://www.catan.com/) Dice (Red and Yellow, some rolled on a white table, 160 on top of or near the Catan board)
- 13 mass groupings of dice in various styles

These images are released for you to use in training your machine learning models.

# Use Cases

This would be a great dataset to test out different object detection models like YOLO v3, MaskRCNN, mobilenet, or others.

You could use it to create dice game helper apps (like a dice counter) or independent games.

# Using this Dataset

We're releasing the data as public domain. Feel free to use it for any purpose.
It's not required to provide attribution, but it'd be nice! :fal-smile-wink:
